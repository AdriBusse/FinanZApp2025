this is the new list of tasks work on it:

- for my new android version the screen dont fit to the boundaries. the must be something like a saveareaview to get implemented. because the app spanns over th whole screen. the action buttons on the bottom cover the navigation. the camera on top cover some text.

- when creating a expense follow the design of the other screens. that include: on the list where all templates are listed the new button have to move to a floating button in green on the right bottom corner of the screen. when i create or edit it i wanna have the same category select as in expense create. that i can see the icon to it. Also the delete and edit action should be represented with icons that are used already in the app.

- when creating an expense the switch with monthly recurring should be under the spending limit in the order.

- the screen templates need a small back action button in the header.

- saving depots have a saving goal value. this schould be displayed throught a horizontal bar chart on the detail screen. it should be displayed next to sum number in green. the color of the barchart is light blue. the bar should be filled up to the saving goal value. the number can be as a label in light gray on the barchart.

- for the expense detail screen i need a horizontal bar chart to display the spending limit. it should be displayed in the stats screen over the pie chart. the color of the barchart is light blue. the bar should be filled up to the spending limit value. the number can be as a label in light gray on the barchart.
