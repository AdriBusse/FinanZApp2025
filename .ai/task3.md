Ensure that the new dashboard also is displays if just the user logout and new login. Right now there need to be a killing of the app before the new dashboard screen is showed. 

The dashboard screen should not be edited through buttons for each direction. Research a nice drag and drop library and install it. Then the positioning should be handled through a drag and drop mechanism where the elements lineup new when I change the order. For delete show a small trash symbol when an element is dragged. When it comes to the trash symbol and released it is deleted. 

Next I wanna work on the profile screen. It should show the users email. That can be taken from the me query. 

Also include some expandable accordion section called change password. There you can enter your current password and twice the new password to change it. Checkout the schema to to see the mutation for change password.
