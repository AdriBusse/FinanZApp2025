this is a list of bugs that zou should fix for the frontend
mosty thez are related to the datafetching logic.




- on the screen for categories the floating button is not stick to the bottom right corner. that can confuse the user on long lists. when the list is long it get out of the screen. do it same as on other screens.

- when creating a new category the sucess function should not automaticly fire when i enter a title and press ok. so just create the category when i press save. the wrong behaiviour is that it create when i leave the name input with the ok button on the keyboard


- when creating an transactions in saving i need first to disable the button while the mutation is running. to prevent a double click and multible creatins.
