this are tasks for the dashboard screen:

- the dashboard screen shoud be best possible custumizable. therefore i wanna start with a empty screen. there is a plus button in one cell of the masionette. This plus button can generate new elements on the screen. When there are more elements the can be dragged to a different position. For that implement something like a lock and move button.

- When add a new element there need to be a menu shown because a lot of custom options should be possible. I will list the functions which are possible to displayed on the dashboard next: 
- You can display the sum of the savingings from a savingaccound the user choose
- Display the total spend of a expense account you choose
- A link to an Expense account that can be chosen. 
- A link to a saving account that can be chosen
- A quick button for get navigated to the expense and open the create form. 
- a net worth display. count the sum of all saving accounts together (number can be found in the sumary query)
- spend today (number can be found in the summary query)
- show latest expense - (number can be found in the summary query)

That are the functions that are possible to select when adding a marionette element on the dashboard. Find a good menu structure which make the customizable process not to complicated. 

The homescreen need to persist. So whenever something is changed save a new version to the local storage. On open the screen the configuration is loaded and the screen is rebuild
